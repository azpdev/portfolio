        <h1>Professional Work Experience</h1>
        <h5><i>*Software related jobs only</i></h5>
        <h2>Full Time Employment</h2>
        <h3>Jerran Software Solutions</h3>
        <p>
          The first software development position I got was the first employee of a consulting firm and we were working
          in the basement apartment living room of one of the founding owners. I was working on my personal laptop and a
          monitor and a kitchen room chair. We then moved to a room in the back of a video game store that the other
          founding owner was starting up. We finally got nicer chairs... After which we finally moved to a legit office
          that was one big room, a back room, and a bathroom. Some shared conference rooms and a shared bathroom with
          other office suites. They got it hoping to expand. They had hired a few other devs in this time and not all of
          them lasted.
        </p>
        <p>
          I may have gotten really lucky with this position due to the direct supervision and mentorship I had from the
          two owners. They entrusted a lot of responsibility to me and moved quickly. I went from being a developer who
          handed small tasks off to to being the contact point for clients. Ultimately, they decided to pursue another
          business venture, and although they offered for any of the current devs to take over the company I decided to
          take a job with a client.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <span class="divider-xs"></span>
        </div>
        <h4>First Project: Store Front</h4>
        <p>
          This position started as a Junior role and I was trained on a project they were using for their video game
          store. It had a SailsJS backend with a MySql Database. I had to run that along with the front-end which was
          written in Angular. My tasks mostly consisted of small things in the front-end that needed to be fixed or
          implemented. Each PR I submitted was carefully reviewed and nitpicked giving clear feedback. They had a high
          standard so that when I got off the project two months later, I could work on the client's sites with a high
          level of detail and care.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <span class="divider-xs"></span>
        </div>
        <h4>Second Project: MTC Embark Language App</h4>
        <p>
          This project is a language app to help LDS missionaries learn a language they are going to use on their
          missions. I only interacted with the front-end and most of the stuff they had for the backend was implemented
          and endpoints were already there for use. This was written in Ionic Cordova with Angular as the front-end
          framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would build out new features they requested in the sprint. As the contractors we were assigned most of the
          bugs and we cranked out the most amount of story points (a meaningless metric especially with such varying
          skill levels and constant turn-over). A few things I accomplished. I added a letter choice to the application.
          I worked on a considerable refactor and redesign implementation. I also took on a heavy task to get the
          downloads to be more consistent and faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this project, the developers in the MTC were mostly students and so some of my role was to help them with
          their tasks. I gained some valuable insight into how to mentor. I was the main contact point for a few months
          and also helped the developers they had hired with their tasks and communicating with the client.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <span class="divider-xs"></span>
        </div>
        <h4>Third Project: Stutor Inc</h4>
        <p>
          They hired a few more developers and were looking to get more contracts. A friend of the owners had a new
          contract that needed an app built and they wanted to do it in Flutter. We used Flutter and Bloc at the
          beginning. They had me learn some Flutter and they learned it too and they took the contract. At first, it was
          just the IOS and Android apps. It was a new framework and language and I was a little slow to pick it up, but
          started to move much faster and learned more after about a month. It gave me more ability to pick up
          frameworks faster and what to do to learn and excel in something new.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the owners was doing it with me at the beginning but he was preparing me to take over the project.
          After a few months, they added two other developers to the project with me and I was the main contact point
          for this project. Along with one foreign developer to help crank out some of the UI faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          This contract was not just one app but it was broken up into three different apps with a shared library. I
          implemented notifications, and messaging reworks with Twilio some in native Kotlin and Swift with some help,
          onboarding, and registration, some of the reworkings of the video chat feature with recordings, and eventually
          added the web app under the company to-dos. We went from just the mobile apps to also the web app as well so
          we had to implement more responsive layouts. I also implemented much of the admin experience.
        </p>

        <div class="center">
          <span class="divider-sm"></span>
        </div>

        <h3>Stutor Inc</h3>
        <p>
          Once the role was ending with Jerran Software Solution, I took a role working directly for the client Stutor.
          I went from a main contributor to their Lead Software Developer in more than name. I managed all the front
          end. Another developer from Jerran joined as well but was moved to the backend. There was a developer on the
          backend that was moved to the front end, and I started to mentor, train, and supervise his contributions. On
          the backend they also had a junior level developer I helped from time to time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The company worked with Distro.io to hire an additional front-end developer. I pushed for one and she got
          hired. She did great work and was easy to work with. Always willing to go the extra mile. I learned a decent
          amount from interviewing other developers and what I would look for. I took ques from Jerran Software
          Solutions hiring process. The key was looking for a personality that would be easy to work with, someone
          willing to take feedback, willing to not know something, and decent technical apitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the time moving to a direct employee, I set up the build pipeline to handle any level of configuration for
          the three environments, the three platforms, the three apps, and the soon-to-be four apps when I left. I also
          transitioned the apps from Twilio for video chat to Agora. They also had us do a big redesign, and I
          restructured it with new routing. We added Stripe into the apps for payments and made it easier to onboard
          users. There was major progress made all the way to be able to have full sessions to be completed and paid for
          by the student to the tutors.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, I parted ways with the company with the desire to begin pursuing my own company. It no longer
          served its purpose, and I needed a break. Multiple late nights, early mornings, and sleepless nights spent. A
          lot of progress was made, and they will likely find a market fit in the coming months, but it was no longer a
          place for me. I wish them the best, and I will be off to a new grind for myself. Greater reward for harder
          work.

          Currently, this is a simple landing page for a landscaping business. I built it in vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS
          with Vite to help with builds, the same as this site. The reviews were hard coded in from the Google API for
          now. I have the code to get them on each load, but I am building out an API to cache the results and to help
          with other functionality. We have plans to expand a few more pages in the coming months as his off-season
          begins.
