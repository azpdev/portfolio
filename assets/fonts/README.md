# Font Files

This directory should contain the Inter font files for self-hosting.

## Download Instructions

1. Visit the Inter font GitHub releases page: https://github.com/rsms/inter/releases

2. Download the latest release ZIP file

3. Extract and copy these files to this directory:
   - `Inter-Variable.woff2` (recommended - all weights in one file)

   OR individual weight files:
   - `Inter-Regular.woff2` (400 weight)
   - `Inter-Medium.woff2` (500 weight)
   - `Inter-Bold.woff2` (700 weight)

## Why Self-Host?

- Faster loading (no external DNS/SSL handshake)
- Better privacy (no Google Fonts tracking)
- More reliable (no dependency on external services)
- Can be cached with your other assets
