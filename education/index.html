        <h1>Education</h1>

        <h2>Salt Lake Community College</h2>
        <h3>Generals and Core Computer Science Classes</h3>
        <p>
          My opinion on the education system as a whole (in the US at least) is
          not very high. I didn't do particularly well in high school.
          Failed/incomplete classes my sophomore year, which made my GPA quite
          low, under 3.0. The rest of my time, I coasted. I didn't even finish a
          full year of math. I got just enough math credits to graduate. I got
          my GPA back up to just above 3.5. It was easy to get A's and not hard
          not to try much to get them. Community is a good route for everyone as
          it is cheaper and you have the ability to try more things if you are
          undecided. I was not undecided then.
        </p>
        <p>
          My view on college is not exactly much better. Most of the generals
          were useless and boring and best case they were a repeat of classes in
          high school. I had been in a few AP classes in high school and they
          were drastically harder than the college equivalents or similar
          courses. So for the most part only thing, the college classes were
          going to get me was credentialism. However, I did really enjoy my
          philosophy courses. The professor was phenomenal, and I got a newfound
          interest. I also picked up Jiu Jitsu after a discussion board
          mentioned trying out kick boxing in my online gym class.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did finally finish a math class. I took the classes that were
          prerequisites for Calculus. The college wanted me to go back to
          Algebra… I made it five minutes in the class before dropping it and
          getting into the harder class. I did half of AP Calculus in high
          school, but it started to get quite difficult about halfway through
          when not finishing previous math classes started to cause issues. I
          also took calculus as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The core computer science classes were not terrible. I took Intro to
          Computer Programming in High School, and that is what sparked my
          interest in programming. I skipped the first class they wanted me to
          because it was too basic. It was more for people who were interested
          in programming but had never done it before. Most of the classes were
          in Java. Object Oriented, Web Programming, Discrete Mathematics,
          Algorithms, Software Development, and Computer Architecture. Learned a
          decent amount in these courses. My overall GPA was high 3.9. Software
          development needs a trade schools and boot camps don't quite do what
          they need to so college is the best bet right now.
        </p>
        <span class="divider"></span>
        <h2>Utah Valley University</h2>
        <h3>Associates in General Studies</h3>
        <h3>Certification of Completion: Programmer</h3>
        <p>
          After getting all the classes I could from SLCC, I transferred to UVU
          to finish my degree. I had enough credits for an associate but not the
          correct courses.
        </p>
        <p>
          At UVU I took all Computer courses. Networking, more discrete math, OS
          Theory, more algorithms, C++, and more web programming. I had some
          good experiences in these courses.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did finally get my first software job at this point. Enviably, I had
          gotten what I wanted from school. I learned a lot, and I can continue
          learning without the structure. Also, the experience has been way more
          valuable, and I can always go back. I was able to apply for both my
          associate and certificate of completion programmer after my first
          semester.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did fail one class when my workload and school load combined was a
          lot. My least liked class, Numerical software development, took a hit.
          It also really needed another prerequisite of Linear Algebra. It
          required you really to learn Numerical Software Development concepts
          and Linear Algebra at the same time. I wasn't about to let all my
          classes suffer, so giving up just one was the best option.
