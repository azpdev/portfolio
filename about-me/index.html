        <h5>
          <i>More info than necessary, so enjoy. Pictures coming later.</i>
        </h5>
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          I was born and raised until almost 12 years old just outside of Portland, Oregon. My family consists of 5
          kids. Two half-siblings, one adopted, and one full sibling, but none of those labels matter to us. I grew up
          in the LDS (Mormon) church going to church every Sunday, but I have since left when I was fifteen. My mother
          was a stay-at-home mother for my early years, but got her degree in teaching and we moved to Utah when she got
          a job here. My dad has worked a variety of jobs. He has taught me a strong work ethic and how to figure out
          and fix many things.
        </p>
        <p>
          We played a lot outside rain or shine until my dad whistled for us to come home. Whether that was on bikes,
          playing a ball sport, roughhousing, or on the trampoline. We also played some video games and board games. It
          was a very typical childhood in the early 2000s. I never really went into sports until I became an adult.
        </p>
        <span class="divider"></span>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          In school, I excelled in math and was not bad at language arts and reading once I learned my eyes were
          technically misaligned and properly learned how to read. I liked math because of its structured nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          In high school, I jumped around from school a little bit and I struggled when push came to shove. It wasn't
          until college did I get back into a groove. Ultimately, I didn't see the worth of school without a clear
          direction so it was hard to be motivated to do homework. I still took a few hard classes, but did drop some of
          them when I had enough credits to graduate like calculus. I took a computer programming class in Java at my
          high school which put me back on a set path for my career.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I got into college my grades went back to mostly because now I had a purpose and was footing some of the
          bill. My parents helped some with tuition, but if I failed then I would be responsible for all of it. Even
          with the general education which was mostly useless due to the fact it wasn't any harder than high school
          courses. I could go on and on about how wasteful generals are for most people. I did however find a new
          interest in philosophy from an amazing Russian Professor. I did like politics before, but philosophy was a
          step above it.
        </p>
        <p>
          To me, college served the purpose of getting employment and gaining some skills for said employment. Once I
          got a software developer position and my pay kept rising... I dropped out. Could have been a mistake. Only
          time will tell.
        </p>
        <span class="divider"></span>
        <h2>Jobs</h2>
        <p>
          I worked a few months after I turned 14. Even before then, I tried to find things to do to make money but was
          not the most successful at it. Because of started early, I worked a lot of different jobs. I did custodial,
          fast food, retail (sorta), a bit of construction labor, call center, and IT. All before I got into the
          software industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first software job was a very good experience. I got a lot of mentorship and opportunities to learn and
          lead. I moved to a new position working for one of the clients when ownership changed. In that position, I
          learned a lot but ultimately came to an end due to the turbulence the business was experiencing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then I have moved on to wanting to start my own business. I am still not sure exactly what will be the
          winning idea, but I have to try as many as I can while I am young. I will do whatever it takes including
          working jobs, I don't like to make ends meet while I give this is an honest go.
        </p>
        <span class="divider"></span>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <h3>Mountain Biking</h3>
        <p>
          I got into biking when I was a kid, but didn't get into mountain biking until high school. I loved it and even
          worked on a bike for a time. However, it has taken a back burner spot while my interest in Jiu Jitsu is much
          greater.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <span class="divider-sm"></span>
        </div>
        <h3>Jiu Jitsu</h3>
        <p>
          I did wrestling my senior year of high school and a partial year my sophomore year and I liked it. It wasn't
          my favorite and I was average at best. In college, I had an online gym class that had us do discussion boards
          and people mentioned kickboxing and I thought why not give it a try? I walked into Absolute MMA and haven't
          left. At the beginning, I was doing a mix of everything and I liked it all, but Jiu-Jitsu is my preference. At
          some point, I may give Muay Thai some more time but right now my focus is the grappling aspect of fighting. I
          regularly compete and I win a decent number of my matches by submission.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <span class="divider-sm"></span>
        </div>
        <h3>Lifting</h3>
        <p>
          I started lifting in high school and have picked it back up off and on since. Ultimately, I wanted to outlive
          my father when he was my age. It is not a small goal, he was a very strong young adult and still very strong
          just in his 60s. I also run to help with my cardio. Currently, I am on a split under 2 days and lower 2 days
          alternating plan. My current goal with it is to be fit for my main hobby of Jiu Jitsu.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <span class="divider-sm"></span>
        </div>
        <h3>Philosophy, Religion, and Politics</h3>
        <p>
          I got into politics just after the 2016 US election. Religion has been a source interest since my Human
          Geography field trip to multiple different places of worship in high school. philosophy became a bigger
          interest after my philosophy teacher sparked that interest. I am in search of truths where I can find them.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <span class="divider-sm"></span>
        </div>
        <h3>Stories</h3>
        <p>
          I love many types and medians of story telling. The few video games I have played that I enjoyed playing alone
          were story primary games. I also like reading sci-fi and fantasy. I also really like movies and shows and I am
          collecting physical copies of ones I like. I likely will do the same with books. At one point I was doing a
          bit of fiction writing in my free time, but haven't in a little while.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <span class="divider-sm"></span>
        </div>
        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p>
          I also really like technology whether it is new stuff coming out or computer building or little micro
          computers. I also keep my eye on technical advancements in other areas like energy.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <span class="divider-sm"></span>
        </div>
        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>
          Some people socially drink and I socially game. I have never been a huge video game player. My favorite game
          is <i>The Last of Us</i>, but other than a few, mostly I like to play games with friends or my brother.
          Recently, I have been playing <i>Hell Diver 2</i> with my older brother.
        </p>
