        <p>More info than necessary, so enjoy. Pictures coming later.</p>
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          I was born and raised until almost 12 years old just outside of
          Portland, Oregon. My family consists of 5 kids. Two half siblings, one
          adopted, and one full sibiling, but none of those labels matter to us.
          I grew up in the LDS (Mormon) church going to church every sunday, but
          I have since left when I was fifteen. My mother was a stay at home
          mother for my early years, but got her degree in teaching and we moved
          to Utah when she got a job here. My dad has worked a variety of jobs.
          He has taught me a strong work ethic and how to figure out and fix
          many things.
        </p>
        <p>
          We played a lot outside rain or shine until my dad whistled for us to
          come home. Whether that was on bikes, playing a ball sport, rough
          housing, or on the trampoline. We also played some video games and
          board games. It was a very typical early 2000s childhood. I never
          really go into sports until I became an adult. My interest was always
          in making things and stories.
        </p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          In school I excelled in math and was not bad at language arts and
          reading once I learned my eyes are technically disaligned and properly
          learned how to read. I really liked math because of its structured
          nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          In high school I jumped around from schools a little bit and I
          struggled when push came to shove. It wasn't until college did I get
          back into a groove. Ultimately, I didn't see the worth of school
          without a clear direction and so it was hard to be motivated to do
          homework. I still took a few hard classes, but did drop some of them
          when I had enough credits to graduate like calculus. I took a computer
          programming class in Java at my high school which put me back on a set
          path for my career.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I got in college my grades went back to mostly as because now I
          had both a purpose and also I was footing some of the bill. My parents
          helped some with tuition, but if I failed then I would be responsible
          for all of it. Even with the general education which was mostly
          useless due to the fact it wasn't any harder than high school courses.
          I could go on and on about how waste ful generals are for most people.
          I did however find a new interest in philosophy from an amazing
          Russian Professor. I did like politics before, but philosophy was a
          step above it.
        </p>
        <p>
          To me college served the purpose of getting employment and gaining
          some skills for said employment. Once I got a software developer
          position and my pay kept rising... I dropped out. Could have been a
          mistake. Only time will tell.
        </p>
        <h2>Jobs</h2>
        <p>
          I worked since a few months after I turned 14. Even before then, I
          tried to find things to do to make money, but was not the most
          successful at it. Because of starting early I worked a lot of
          different jobs. I did custodial, fast food, retail (sorta), a bit of
          construction labor, call center and IT. All before I got into the
          software industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first software job was a very good experience. I got a lot of
          mentorship and oppurtunities to learn and lead. I moved to a new
          position working for one of the clients when ownership changed. That
          position I learned a lot, but ultimately came to end due to turbelence
          the business was experiencing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then I have moved on to wanting to start my own business. I am
          still not sure exactly what will be the winning idea, but I got to try
          as many as I can while I am young. I will do whatever it takes
          including working jobs I don't like to make ends meet while I give
          this an honest go.
        </p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <h3>Mountain Biking</h3>
        <p>
          I got into biking when I was a kid, but didn't get into mountain
          biking until high school. I loved it and even worked in a bike for a
          time. However, it has taken a back burner spot while my interest in
          Jiu Jitsu is much greater.
        </p>
        <h3>Jiu Jitsu</h3>
        <p>
          I did wrestling my senior year of high school and I liked it. It
          wasn't my favorite and I was average at best. In college I had an
          online gym class that had us do discussion boards and people mentioned
          kick boxing and I thought why not give it a try. I walked into
          Absolute MMA and haven't left. At the beginning I was doing a mix of
          everything and I liked it all, but Jiu Jitsu is my preference. At some
          point I may give Muay Thai some more time but right now my focus is
          grappling aspect of fighting. I regularly compete and I win a decent
          number of my matches by submission.
        </p>
        <h3>Lifting</h3>
        <p>
          I started lifting in high school and have picked it back up off and on
          since. Ultimately, I really wanted to out lift my father when he was
          my age. It is not a small goal, he was a very strong young adult and
          still very strong just into his 60s. I also run to help with my
          cardio. Currently, I am on a split upder 2 days and lower 2 days
          alternating plan. My current goal with it is to be fit for my main
          hobby of Jiu Jitsu.
        </p>
        <h3>Philosophy, Religion, and Politics</h3>
        <p>
          I got into politics just after the 2016 US election. Religion has been
          a source interest since my Human Geography field trip to multiple
          different places of worship in high school. philosophy became a bigger
          interest after my philosophy teacher sparked that interest. I am in
          search of truths where I can find it.
        </p>
        <h3>Stories</h3>
        <p>
          I love many types and medians of story telling. The few video games I
          have played that I really enjoyed playing alone were story primary
          games. I also like reading scifi and fantasy. I also really like
          movies and shows and I am collecting physical copies of ones I like. I
          likely will do the same with books.
        </p>
        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p>
          I also really like technology whether it is new stuff coming out or
          computer building or little micro computers. I also keep my eye on
          technical kno
        </p>
        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>
          Some people socially drink and I socially game. I have never been a
          huge video game player. My favorite game is <i>The Last of Us</i>, but
          other than a few mostly I like to play games with friends or my
          brother. Recently, I have been playing <i>Hell Diver 2</i> with my
          older brother.
        </p>

<!-- <p>
  My first software development position I got was the first employee of
  a consulting firm and we were working in the basement apartment living
  room of one of founding owners. I was working on my personal laptop
  and a monitor and a kitchen room chair. We then moved to a room in the
  back of a video game store that the other founding owner was starting
  up. We finally got nicer chairs... After which we finally moved to a
  legit office that was one big room, a back room, and a bathroom. Some
  shared conference rooms and a shared bathroom with other office
  suites. They got it hoping to expand. They had hired a few other devs
  in this time and not all of them lasted.
</p>
<p>
  I may have got really lucky with this position due to the direct
  supervision and mentorship I had from the two owners. They entrusted a
  lot of responsiblity to me and moved really quickly
