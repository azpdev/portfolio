Pictures coming later.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>I was born and raised until almost 12 years old just outside of Portland, Oregon. My family consists of 5 kids. Two half-siblings, one adopted, and one full sibling, but none of those labels matter to us. I grew up in the LDS (Mormon) church going to church every Sunday, but I have since left when I was fifteen. My mother was a stay-at-home mother for my early years, but got her degree in teaching and we moved to Utah when she got a job here. My dad has worked a variety of jobs. He has taught me a strong work ethic and how to figure out and fix many things.</p><p>We played a lot outside rain or shine until my dad whistled for us to come home. Whether that was on bikes, playing a ball sport, roughhousing, or on the trampoline. We also played some video games and board games. It was a very typical childhood in the early 2000s. I never really went into sports until I became an adult.</p><h2>Education</h2><p>In school, I excelled in math and was not bad at language arts and reading once I learned my eyes were technically misaligned and properly learned how to read. I liked math because of its structured nature.</p><p>In high school, I jumped around from school a little bit and I struggled when push came to shove. It wasn't until college did I get back into a groove. Ultimately, I didn't see the worth of school without a clear direction so it was hard to be motivated to do homework. I still took a few hard classes, but did drop some of them when I had enough credits to graduate like calculus. I took a computer programming class in Java at my high school which put me back on a set path for my career.</p><p>Once I got into college my grades went back to mostly because now I had a purpose and was footing some of the bill. My parents helped some with tuition, but if I failed then I would be responsible for all of it. Even with the general education which was mostly useless due to the fact it wasn't any harder than high school courses. I could go on and on about how wasteful generals are for most people. I did however find a new interest in philosophy from an amazing Russian Professor. I did like politics before, but philosophy was a step above it.</p><p>To me, college served the purpose of getting employment and gaining some skills for said employment. Once I got a software developer position and my pay kept rising... I dropped out. Could have been a mistake. Only time will tell.</p><h2>Jobs</h2><p>I worked a few months after I turned 14. Even before then, I tried to find things to do to make money but was not the most successful at it. Because of started early, I worked a lot of different jobs. I did custodial, fast food, retail (sorta), a bit of construction labor, call center, and IT. All before I got into the software industry.</p><p>My first software job was a very good experience. I got a lot of mentorship and opportunities to learn and lead. I moved to a new position working for one of the clients when ownership changed. In that position, I learned a lot but ultimately came to an end due to the turbulence the business was experiencing.</p><p>Since then I have moved on to wanting to start my own business. I am still not sure exactly what will be the winning idea, but I have to try as many as I can while I am young. I will do whatever it takes including working jobs, I don't like to make ends meet while I give this is an honest go.</p><h2>Hobbies</h2><h3>Mountain Biking</h3><p>I got into biking when I was a kid, but didn't get into mountain biking until high school. I loved it and even worked on a bike for a time. However, it has taken a back burner spot while my interest in Jiu Jitsu is much greater.</p><h3>Jiu Jitsu</h3><p>I did wrestling my senior year of high school and a partial year my sophomore year and I liked it. It wasn't my favorite and I was average at best. In college, I had an online gym class that had us do discussion boards and people mentioned kickboxing and I thought why not give it a try? I walked into Absolute MMA and haven't left. At the beginning, I was doing a mix of everything and I liked it all, but Jiu-Jitsu is my preference. At some point, I may give Muay Thai some more time but right now my focus is the grappling aspect of fighting. I regularly compete and I win a decent number of my matches by submission.</p><h3>Lifting</h3><p>I started lifting in high school and have picked it back up off and on since. Ultimately, I wanted to outlive my father when he was my age. It is not a small goal, he was a very strong young adult and still very strong just in his 60s. I also run to help with my cardio. Currently, I am on a split under 2 days and lower 2 days alternating plan. My current goal with it is to be fit for my main hobby of Jiu Jitsu.</p><h3>Philosophy, Religion, and Politics</h3><p>I got into politics just after the 2016 US election. Religion has been a source interest since my Human Geography field trip to multiple different places of worship in high school. philosophy became a bigger interest after my philosophy teacher sparked that interest. I am in search of truths where I can find them.</p><h3>Stories</h3><p>I love many types and medians of story telling. The few video games I have played that I enjoyed playing alone were story primary games. I also like reading sci-fi and fantasy. I also really like movies and shows and I am collecting physical copies of ones I like. I likely will do the same with books.</p><h3>Technology</h3><p>I also really like technology whether it is new stuff coming out or computer building or little micro computers. I also keep my eye on technical advancements in other areas like energy.</p><h3>Gaming</h3><p>Some people socially drink and I socially game. I have never been a huge video game player. My favorite game is <i>The Last of Us</i>, but other than a few mostly I like to play games with friends or my brother. Recently, I have been playing <i>Hell Diver 2</i> with my older brother.</p><h2>Goals</h2><p><i>In no particular order.</i></p><ul><li>Work for myself full time</li><li>Get to the top of the podium in Jiu Jitsu at a major IBJJF tournament</li><li>Get married and have kids</li><li>Buy a home</li><li>Live on a farm</li></ul><p>A few things I am doing to achieve those goals.</p><ul><li>Learning new skills</li><li>Investigating business oppurtunities</li><li>Taking note of what other business people are running around me</li><li>Working out 4 times a week to get stronger</li><li>Adding Judo into my training</li><li>Working on different projects</li><li>Seeking knowledge to be a better person for my future wife</li></ul></div></main><footer><section class="site-info"><h5>Made in plain JS, HTML, and CSS by Alex Z.
